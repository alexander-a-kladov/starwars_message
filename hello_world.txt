Hello World
Poem by Bill Simmons

Hello world,
Another day you turn
Another day will come what may
The eye of a needle
A pin head they say
One soul dies
One soul takes life
Searching forever
What's wrong and what's right
Does it matter
What they see in their eyes
Does it matter
What they never learn
Still world you turn,
Still world
You will hear babies cry
Stars in the heavens
Will light up your night
The moon will ever
Keep glowing bright
And it won't matter at all
If it's wrong or right,
Under the presence of your keeping
We will live out our whole lives
Haunted still
Worried the right
Tomorrow another
Tear will fall
Another child born
Despite it all
And if not now
Nothing have we learned
Worry not my world
For still you turn.
